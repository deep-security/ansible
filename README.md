# Project Retired

Recent releases of Trend Micro Deep Security provide an improved in-product experience of creating a deployment script for deploying the Deep Security Agent. With these improvements, it's easier to deploy the agent via an Ansible playbook. Therefore this project has been retired and archived.

For more information, please refer to [Use the Deep Security Deployment Scripts](https://automation.deepsecurity.trendmicro.com/article/12_1/use-the-deep-security-deployment-scripts?platform=dsaas) in the Deep Security Automation Center and [Command-line basics](https://help.deepsecurity.trendmicro.com/command-line-utilities.html) in the Deep Security Help Center.
