# Project Retired

Recent released of Trend Micro's Deep Security provide an improved in-product experience of creating a deployment script for deploying the Deep Security Agent. With these improvements, it's trivial to deploy the agent via a simple Ansible playback. Therefore, this project will be retired and archived.

For more information, please refer to, "[Use the Deep Security Deployment Scripts](https://automation.deepsecurity.trendmicro.com/article/12_1/use-the-deep-security-deployment-scripts?platform=dsaas)" in the Deep Security Automation Center and, "[Command-line basics](https://help.deepsecurity.trendmicro.com/command-line-utilities.html?Highlight=ds_agent)" in the Deep Security Help Center.
