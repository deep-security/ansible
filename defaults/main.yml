# As you add agents to Deep Security, they are automatically made available for download through
#   the same hostname:port as the Deep Security Manager admin interface. For Marketplace and software deployments, pass
#   this data through the 'dsm_agent_download_hostname' & 'dsm_agent_download_port' attributes.

# Deep Security agents activate on a different port than the admin interface. For Marketplace and
#    software deployments, 'dsm_agent_activation_hostname' is typically the same as 'dsm_agent_download_hostname'
#    but 'dsm_agent_activation_port' is different than 'dsm_agent_download_port'. For Deep Security
#    as a Service, it's the reverse to make it easy to configure only one outbound port.

# For multi-tenant deployments of Deep Security (such as Deep Security as a Service), every tenant/organization
#    is assigned a unique 'tenant_id' and 'token' that is only used for agent activation. You can
#    find this info from the Support/Help > Deployment Scripts menu in the Deep Security Manager. Select any agent
#    and then enable "Activate Agent automatically after installation". This places the tenant_id and 
#    token in the script the wizard is building for you.
